## Hi there. I'm Steven and Taerim is my in-game nickname ðŸ‘‹

My GitHub username is different because someone else already used it :upside_down_face:, then I combined it with Taerim+Taeyeon (one of my favourite singer :partying_face:), anyways.. welcome to my GitHub! 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: my thesis :sweat_smile:.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Kotlin and Basic Android App making, also still in the process to improve my Python programming.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: would love to have another practice and get some hands-on with any embedded system projects (esp Arduino and RaspberryPi)!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: minimizing GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) artifacts, if you know how to do this it will help me a lot! My thesis requires me to get my hands dirty with this particular Deep Learning model.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: any historical events? Like literally, because I love history :monocle_face:.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you could reach me through these social media, just tap/click on the respective icons below! The contents might not be updated regularly but I'm still active there!
